# BEV2EGO

Codebase for the paper "Detection of Systematic Errors in Object Detectors via Controlled Realistic Scene Generation."

## Abstract

This repository contains the codebase for our research on detecting systematic errors in object detectors through controlled realistic scene generation. Our method, BEV2EGO, leverages bird's-eye view (BEV) configurations to generate first-person view (EGO) scenes, enabling a comprehensive analysis of state-of-the-art object detection models.

## The Method

Our approach allows for realistic generation of complete scenes with road-contingent control, mapping 2D BEV scene configurations to EGO perspectives. We propose a benchmark for controlled scene generation and perform a systematic analysis of multiple SOTA object detection models to identify their differences.
