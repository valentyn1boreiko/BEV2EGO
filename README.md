# BEV2EGO

Codebase for the paper "Detection of Systematic Errors in Object Detectors via Controlled Realistic Scene Generation"

# The method

Our approach, BEV2EGO, allows for a realistic generation of the complete scene with road-contingent control that maps 2D bird's-eye view (BEV) scene configurations to a first-person view (EGO). In addition, we propose a benchmark for controlled scene generation to select the most appropriate generative outpainting model for BEV2EGO. We further use it to perform a systematic analysis of multiple state-of-the-art (SOTA) object detection models and discover differences between them.
